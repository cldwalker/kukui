## Description

*Work in Progress* kukui explores switching views in outlines. This is achieved by tagging concepts
in an outline, grouping tags and then switching to a new view based on those groups. The goal is to facilitate
insight into an outline as its being created. kukui depends on [sacha](https://github.com/cldwalker/sacha) for outlining. kukui means light or enlightenment in hawaiian.
